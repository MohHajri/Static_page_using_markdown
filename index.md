#### **Why games?**

> "You have not seen desperation and helplessness till you have seen a man hopeless in love. Of course, unless you have seen a gamer" <br /> - Vineet Raj Kapoor.
> <br />

> "Gamers both demand and deserve novelty. They need something new. As a game developer, one of my rules is there will be at least one thing in every game that I worked on that no one on the planet has seen before." <br /> - Warren Spector.
> <br />

> "Everybody wants to game; whether you're a casual gamer, or you're an enthusiast gamer, there's a large market for us." <br /> - Lisa Su.
